## ðŸ§­ Mission & Doctrine

This is not a simple timer. It is a **Somatic Operations Device** built on three core principles:

1.  **Sovereignty:** This application is 100% client-side. It runs entirely in your browser. No data is ever collected, transmitted, or stored on any server. Your routines and preferences are your own.
2.  **Precision:** Designed for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), Pomodoro techniques, yoga, meditation, and any discipline that requires precise control over work and rest periods.
3.  **Resilience:** Built with modern web standards to be as robust as possible, providing a reliable experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

## ðŸ’¡ Core Features

*   **Dual Interval Timers:** Set distinct timers for your "Go" (work) and "Chill" (rest) periods.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop browsers and mobile phones.
*   **Visual Feedback System:** The app's background color changes to provide instant, non-auditory cues for the current state (Go, Chill, or Paused).
*   **Set/Rep Counter:** Automatically tracks the number of completed "Go" intervals.
*   **Customizable Audio Alerts:** Choose from a library of notification sounds in the settings panel to signal interval changes.
*   **Ambient Soundscapes:** Integrated royalty-free audio tracks to provide background ambience for your workout or meditation.
*   **Integrated Clock:** Easily switch between the timer and a full real-time clock with date display.
*   **100% Secure & Private:** Zero data collection, zero cookies, zero trackers.
